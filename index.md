# Research Interest

I develop and use *ab initio* methods to simulate carrier dynamics in materials. By developing and applying the first-priniciple's computation methods, I am interested in illustrating the ultrafast process of the excited carriers' motion in various materials/devices, including bulk materials, interfaces, chemical reactions, and nano-materials. Understanding these processes will help to design more efficient materials or devices. [more](/_research/research.md)
