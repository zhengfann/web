## About me

I am Fan Zheng, a postdoc fellow working in Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.
chemistry. I am a theoretical material scientist. Instead of synthesizing 
a material on a bench, I prefer to use supercomputers to model the material, 
understand the deep science, or even design a material which never exists before.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Unversity of Pennsylvania in Dec/2016, department of
chemistry. My thesis is focusing on solar cells, particularly, concerning 
mechanism of the bulk photovoltaic effect and halide perovskite.[more](/pages/cv.md)

## Research Interest

I develop and use *ab initio* methods to simulate carrier dynamics in materials. 
By developing and applying the first-priniciple's computation methods, I am 
interested in illustrating the ultrafast process of the excited carriers' 
motion in various materials/devices, including bulk materials, interfaces, 
chemical reactions, and nano-materials. Understanding these processes will 
help to design more efficient materials or devices. [more](/pages/research.md)
