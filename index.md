##Research interest
---
My research is mainly focused on using first-principle's method to 
understand carrier dynamics and light-matter interaction in various 
materials. I am interested in developing *ab 
initio* electronic structure techniques and applying these methods to 
study charge transfer across interfaces, electron-phonon coupling, 
large polaron and electrochemistry.[more.](/pages/)

##About me
---
I am a postdoc fellow working in Lawrence Berkeley National Lab 
starting from end of year 2016. My Ph.D. is obtained in University 
of Pennsylvania by working with Professor Andrew Rappe focusing on bulk 
photovoltaic effect and halide perovskite. Before it, my 
undergraduate is in University of Science and Technology of China 
(USTC) department of Chemical physics.
